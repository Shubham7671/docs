### Get Project By Project Id

You can also hit the get project endpoint to get the response.
Refer to the [Get Project Page](/getProject).

### Webhook Response

When Quickreel completes processing your request, it sends a webhook response to the URL specified in the `webhookUrl` parameter. Below is an example of the response you will receive:

```json
{
  "projectId": "676409ad10ded0f9fc89d224",
  "status": "completed",
  "createdAt": "2024-12-19T11:55:25.602Z",
  "completedAt": "2024-12-19T14:22:35.533Z",
  "error": null,
  "outputs": [
    {
      "id": "67640a41df9247bc89de7813",
      "videoUrl": "https://qr-be-api-upload.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/67618d230847a22a7550faf9/676409ad10ded0f9fc89d224/67640a41df9247bc89de7813_final_hook.mp4"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response Attributes:**

- `projectId`: The unique identifier of the project.
